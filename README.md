# Azure Search - Query Classification

Search experiences are all around us, empowering us to quickly find the documents, websites, products and answers that we're looking for. 

For years, search engines have employed complex machine learning techniques to more deeply understand what users are searching for and to help them find it. 
These techniques enable search engines to semantically understand a user's query, to know that Debussy was a classical musician, that a dog is a pet, and that Python and JavaScript are programming languages. 

In catalog search, semantically understanding the intent and extracting the entities in the query is crucial to provide useful results. Whenever the users type "blue girl cardigan", they expect the search engine to correctly identify the color as well as the specific product type and their intent to get back only female products.

Though these techniques help us find what we're looking for, they have not been available to enterprises who want to build their own semantic search capabilities.

[Azure Cognitive Search](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/search/search-what-is-azure-search) aims to provide [semantic understanding](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/search/semantic-search-overview) capabilities to search, so that any enterprise can build much more natural search experiences.

## About this repo

This sample demonstrates how we can use word embeddings from Large Language Models (LLMs) with Azure Cognitive Search to create search experiences that understand the relationships between the entities in a query and the products in a catalog.

The project combines [OpenAI embedding models](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/embeddings) and Azure Cognitive Search to enhance search relevancy by adding a semantic understanding layer in query composition. Whenever a user searches for something, it is crucial to understand his/her intent to provide a tailored result set, considering both the entities in the query and the semantic similarity to the available products. 

The solution creates an embedding representation of a product catalog to improve search relevancy by applying an implicit semantic classification step whenever a user submits a new query.
The code extracts product data from a search index, computes and stores the embeddings based on OpenAI model (ada, babbage or curie) and applies the same embedding technique to every new unseen query coming to the engine. The query embeddings are evaluated against the embeddings matrix to determine the semantic similarity score and return possible filters criteria, boosting criteria or query expansion with confidence thresholds. 

This project also converts natural language into Lucene queries using a few-shot approach and OpenAI text generation models as an alternative for query composition.

The code is split into two different logical components to facilitate re-use and an easy integration in any application layer of your choice:
-   docker-api: core component computing the embedding matrix for the product catalog and exposing an API for query embedding and semantic scoring
-   docker-web: a sample experimentation UI to visualize embeddings results and threshold to test your dataset and defining the right filtering, boosting and query expansion logic 

Both components are dockerized for easy deployment on multiple platforms and integration with existing applications. 

## Statement of Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to grow the understanding of using Large Language Models in Azure Cognitive Search by providing an example of implementation and references to support the [Microsoft Build conference in 2022](https://mybuild.microsoft.com/). It is not intended to be a released product. Therefore, this repository is not for discussing OpenAI API, Azure Cognitive Search or requesting new features.

## How semantic search changes the results set
Let's see how semantic understanding changes the results set with a sample query.

The "girl yellow cardigan" query is analyzed and three entities are extracted as the most probable match, also with their attribute key.
So, "yellow" is classified as color, "cardigan" as a product type and "girl" clearly indicates the need for "female" as product gender.

Using this information, a filter on the product gender is applied to return just products classified as "Female" and a boost is pushing "yellow" products on top of the results set.
You can easily compare the results in the following image.

## Using the App

Example queries:
-    girl yellow cardigan
-    women white belted coat


## How to use embeddings
The core of the repo is using the _encode_ function from __sentence_transformers__ library and _get_embeddings_ from __openai__ library to compute the embedding representations of the product attributes available in a sample product catalog.
```python 
# docker-api\code\utilities\utils.py
def compute_terms_embeddings(model,terms, path=os.getcwd()):
    if model['family'] == SentenceTransformer:
        start_time = datetime.datetime.now()
        terms_embedding = model['model'].encode(list(map(lambda x: x['value'], terms)))
        end_time = datetime.datetime.now()
        difference_in_ms = (end_time - start_time).total_seconds()*1000
        logging.info("terms", '(encoded in', difference_in_ms, 'ms)')
        np.save(os.path.join(path, 'embeddings' , model['name']), terms_embedding)
        return terms_embedding

    elif model['family'] == 'GPT-3':
        df_terms = pd.DataFrame(terms)        
        start_time = datetime.datetime.now()
        df_terms['gpt_3_search'] = df_terms.value.apply(lambda x: get_embedding(x, engine= model['name']))
        end_time = datetime.datetime.now()
        difference_in_ms = (end_time - start_time).total_seconds()*1000
        logging.info("terms", '(encoded in', difference_in_ms, 'ms)')
        df_terms.to_csv(os.path.join(path, 'embeddings' , f"{model['name']}.csv"))
        return df_terms
```

Whenever a user submits a query, the same libraries are used to compute the embeddings for the whole sentence and the single words in it and semantically rank this terms list against all available product attributes.

```python
# docker-api\code\utilities\utils.py
def process_query(query, terms_embedding, model, terms):
    if model['family'] == SentenceTransformer:
        start_time = datetime.datetime.now()
        query_embedding = model['model'].encode(query)
        end_time = datetime.datetime.now()
        difference_in_ms = (end_time - start_time).total_seconds()*1000
        logging.info(query, '(encoded in', difference_in_ms, 'ms)')

        logging.info(f'Using cos_similarity for {model["name"]}')
        scores = util.cos_sim(query_embedding, terms_embedding).numpy()[0]

        terms_score = []
        counter = 0
        for score in scores:
            terms_score.append(
                {
                    "term": terms[counter]['value'],
                    "key" : terms[counter]['key'],
                    "score" : str(score),
                    "query" : query,
                    "model_name" : model['name']
                }
            )
            counter+=1

        return sorted(terms_score, key = lambda i: i['score'],reverse=True)

    else:

        start_time = datetime.datetime.now()
        query_embedding = get_embedding(query, engine=model['name'])
        end_time = datetime.datetime.now()
        difference_in_ms = (end_time - start_time).total_seconds()*1000
        logging.info(query, '(encoded in', difference_in_ms, 'ms)')
        
        terms_embedding['score'] = terms_embedding.gpt_3_search.apply(lambda x: cosine_similarity(x, query_embedding))
        
        res = terms_embedding.sort_values('score', ascending=False).head(5)

        res.drop(['gpt_3_search'], axis=1, inplace=True)
        res['query'] = query
        res['model_name'] = model['name']
        
        return res.to_dict('records')
```

### Client
[Streamlit Debugging](https://awesome-streamlit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/vscode.html)

## Undestand the Code
### Server (docker-api)
-   `api.py` is the main entry point for the app, it uses FastAPI to serve RESTful APIs.
-   `utilities` is the module with utilities to extract product catalog data, compute embeddings and the semantic similarity score for a new query

### Client (docker-web)
-   `ui.py` is the entry to bootstrap the Streamlit web application
-   `utilities` is the module with utilities for interact with the search index and the server-side
